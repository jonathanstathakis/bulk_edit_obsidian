      "A major goal of this study was to develop a MS Excel spreadsheet with the ability to analyze sample antioxidant chromatograms with any number of peaks. This was to provide a foundation for further authentication by orthogonality studies. MS Excel was the platform of choice for a number of reasons: It is ubiquitous, any user with a Microsoft Office software license has access to it. Furthermore, the sheet was built without including any Microsoft exclusive features so as to be usable on Google Sheets, Libre Office's Calc program, and legacy versions of Excel #checkthis. It is a platform that requires no programming knowledge to interact with, and users can easily modify as required or connect to other sheets for further calculations. The design is such that users simply need to input the peak height values and the spreadsheet will plot the peak height pairs to visualise the 2D distribution and calculate the mutual information as a percentage.

      "The primary method of initializing a dataframe is through the use of dictionaries, where the dictionary key is a column header, and the values are the entries. Row labels (indexes) can be entered at the same time:\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Pandas has two datatypes, Dataframes and Series. Series are lists, 1D columns with no header, but an overall name, and corresponding index values. \n",
      "\n",
      "When reading from a .csv file, we can assign a column as the index through a constructor parameter:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import pandas as pd\n",

      "```\n",
      "# 2 Indexing, Selecting and Assigning\n",
      "In pandas dataframes, each column is an attribute that can be accessed through the dot operator, but it can also be accessed through the index operator, returning a Series data type:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import pandas as pd\n",
      "\n",
      "## dot operator\n",
      "column = df.colName\n",
      "\n",
      "## index operator\n",
      "column = df['column']\n",
      "```\n",
      "The advantage of the index operator is that it can be used to access columns with reserved characters in their name, such as spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "loc and iloc are another method of accessing columns and entries, and are required for advanced use cases. Loc is a label-based selection, and iloc is an index-based selection.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import pandas as pd\n",
      "\n",
      "df = pd.DataFrame({'points' : [1,2,3], 'DOB' : [20220622, 20220623, 20220624]}, index = ['Bob', 'Raymond', 'Sue'])\n",

      "Sidenote: where Python orders matrix access as `[column, row]`, Pandas uses `[row, column]`.\n",
      "\n",
      "iloc takes slices. To return a whole column through iloc, use `df.iloc[:,0]` for example. It also takes lists, in order to return non-sequentially columns / rows: `df.iloc[[1,2,7],:]`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, loc counts differently to normal Python, in that when using name references, it will return the thing referenced, rather than the 1 before it. This is done because generally, if you are refering to something, you want it included in the selection. iloc acts as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can use `pd.set_index()` to change which df column is the index column by inputting the name of the desired column. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Conditional selection\n",
      "We can create logical masks of the df to create subsets based on a condition, such as:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "df.colName == 'value'\n",
      "```\n",
      "Will return a boolean dataframe containing True wherever the value is, and False elsewhere. \n",

      "# 3 Summary Functions and Maps\n",
      "Summary functions are functions that summarise or describe the dataframe, suhch as `df.describe()` which returns summary statistics based on the datatype of the target column, i.e. normal distribution descriptions for numerical variables, frequencies for categorical variables. \n",

      "A list of unique entries in a column can be returned with `pd.unique(df)`, wheras a Series of each unique column entry and its count can be found using `df.value_counts()` . This function returns a Series where each entry contains multiple column values and their counts. It's weird. \n",

      "There are three methods to combine dataframes, `.concat()`, `.join()`, `.merge()`. Concat simply joins the subject dataframes according to the direction of the join specified, wheras join attempts to find common elements to join together to retain data integrity, depending on the type of join specified. `.merge()` behaves very similar to `.join()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Join can retain information about where the joined columns came from by specifying left suffixes and right suffixes, respectively, based on the direction of the join. i.e.:\n",

      "\n",
      "An environment in Python is the context in which a python program runs.\n",
      "\n",
      "An environment consists of an interpreter and any installed packages.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Global and Virtual Environments\n",
      "By default any Python interpreter that is installed has its own global environment, not specific to any project. Consequently, any packages installed/uninstalled in the global environment affect all programs run in that context.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that over time the environment gets cluttered, making it difficult to test a program against a specific set of packages with known versions, as you would on a build server or web server.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of this, developers use virtual environments for projects$$$$.\n",
      "\n",
      "A virtual environment is a subfolder in a project that contains a copy of a specific interpreter. Packages installed are only installed in that environment's subfolder, and not available in the global environment. The program also does not access the global environment, rather the subfolder.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conda Environments\n",
      "Conda environments are managed by `conda` package manager. \n",
      "\n",
      "Conda works well to create environments with interrelated dependencies, and binary packages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conda enviornments differ from virtual environments in that the environment is available globally on any computer, making it easy to configure several different environments and choosing an appropriate one for a project.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Where the extension looks for the project\n",
      "- standard install paths: /user/local/bin, /user/sbin, /sbin, c:\\\\python27, c:\\\\python36 etc.\n",
      "- virtual environments located under the workspace (project) folder.\n",

This was to provide a foundation for further authentication by orthogonality studies. MS Excel was the platform of choice for a number of reasons: It is ubiquitous, any user with a Microsoft Office software license has access to it. Furthermore, the sheet was built without including any Microsoft exclusive features so as to be usable on Google Sheets, Libre Office's Calc program, and legacy versions of Excel #checkthis. It is a platform that requires no programming knowledge to interact with, and users can easily modify as required or connect to other sheets for further calculations. The design is such that users simply need to input the peak height values and the spreadsheet will plot the peak height pairs to visualise the 2D distribution and calculate the mutual information as a percentage. Please see the #supportingInformation for more details. \n",

      "\n",

      "# 2 Indexing, Selecting and Assigning\n",
      "In pandas dataframes, each column is an attribute that can be accessed through the dot operator, but it can also be accessed through the index operator, returning a Series data type:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import pandas as pd\n",
      "\n",
      "## dot operator\n",

      "\n",
      "Finally, loc counts differently to normal Python, in that when using name references, it will return the thing referenced, rather than the 1 before it. This is done because generally, if you are refering to something, you want it included in the selection. iloc acts as expected.\n",

      "# 3 Summary Functions and Maps\n",
      "Summary functions are functions that summarise or describe the dataframe, suhch as `df.describe()` which returns summary statistics based on the datatype of the target column, i.e. normal distribution descriptions for numerical variables, frequencies for categorical variables. \n",

This is a method of the groupby object, hence you need to groupby, then aggregate the summaries. While the default behavior is to pass a list of function names, you can also input any function, as long as it works when passed a df, or when passed to `df.apply()`.\n",

      "You can groupby on multiple levels of discrimination, i.e. a top level category, then subcategories. For example, `df.groupby(['Country', 'State'])` where each element of the list corresponds to a column of the df. This action produces a groupby object with a multiindex, when operations are applied, it returns a multiindex df. From this point on, to access entries in the multiindexed df, you need to pass a list to the index that contains those categories, in the correct order. This behavior can be removed by applying `df.reset_index()`.\n",

      "## Global and Virtual Environments\n",
      "By default any Python interpreter that is installed has its own global environment, not specific to any project. Consequently, any packages installed/uninstalled in the global environment affect all programs run in that context.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that over time the environment gets cluttered, making it difficult to test a program against a specific set of packages with known versions, as you would on a build server or web server.\n",

      "Because of this, developers use virtual environments for projects$$$$.\n",
